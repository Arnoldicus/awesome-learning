            Awesome Learning is best when run in a group setting. Your group can be co-located or remote. Here are some battle-tested ground rules.

              Limit the group size to a maximum of 6. Anything more can limit individual participation.

              Strive to find a group of roughly similar skill levels. This isn't an exact science, but mixing highly experienced and in-experienced folks together can sometimes lead to being too bored or too challenged on a subject.

            Anyone can form a team. Once you gather a team, the team selects the "course" they want to learn first. Each course has pre-built hour-long lessons with learning materials and coding exercises included. We provide completed solutions and learning annotations to make sure you never get stuck.

            Awesome learning is a research-backed learning platform designed to help small teams build lasting, foundational skills. The platform is a series of videos, reading materials, and exercises in one hour intervals divided into subject-matter "courses". Reading quizzes keep learners engaged, surveys keep leaders up to date with how well team members are learning. TDD exercises provide a tight feedback loop.

            It varies. Some of our courses contain 2 lessons, others contain 5. The recommended cadence is one lesson or per week. We don't reccommend a slower cadence than once per week. Our experience shows folks lose too much course context when more than a week passes in between lessons.
